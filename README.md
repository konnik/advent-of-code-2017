# Advent Of Code 2017 in Elm

Trying to solve Advent Of Code 2017 in Elm. 

This is my first time trying out Elm so please bear with me...  :-)

## How to run

1. [Install elm](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install.html)
2. Clone source 
3. Put your AoE input for a particular problem in inputs/&lt;year&gt;/day-&lt;day&gt;.txt
4. From project folder run:
   ```
    elm-package install
    elm-reactor
   ```
5. Point your browser to http://localhost:8000/App.elm
6. Enjoy! :)

Note: My personal puzzle inputs are included and used by default. 
If you want to use your own inputs, just check "Use custom input" 
and provide your data in the textarea.
